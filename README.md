## Setup
Project is built using latest stable rust toolchain versions. On windows, just installing the rust/cargo toolchain is enough to get building.
On Linux there are a few extra things you may need, see [Bevy Linux Dependencies](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md)

Art assets are created in aesprite, the .aesprite files are checked in to the sprites folder.

Level designs are created in LDtK, which is available on itch.io. (Currently the supported version is a little outdated, currently using LDtk 1.3.3)
